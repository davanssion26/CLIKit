Social media campaigns, documentaries, and celebrity stories about fertility struggles made the topic less stigmatized.</li> <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> The development of innovative treatments like egg freezing, IVF (In Vitro Fertilization), and genetic testing for embryos led to significant improvements in success rates.</li> <li><strong>Government Support:</strong> In many countries, governments provided subsidies or insurance coverage for fertility treatments, further driving the market growth.</li> <li><strong>Rise in Delayed Parenthood:</strong> As women delayed childbirth for career and personal reasons, infertility treatments such as IVF became more in demand.</li> <li><strong>Enhanced Diagnostic Tools:</strong> Non-invasive diagnostic tools such as hormone testing, ultrasound imaging, and laparoscopy provided more accurate and faster results.</li></ul><h2>Shifting Demand from 2023 to 2033: Whatâ€™s Next for the Market?</h2><p>Looking ahead, the female infertility diagnosis and treatment market is poised for continued evolution. The demand for services will see new dynamics between 2023 and 2033 due to:</p><ul> <li><strong>Increased Accessibility:</strong> Expanding fertility clinics and telemedicine services will make infertility diagnosis and treatment more accessible to women worldwide.
